Cadmuim
=======

Cadmium is a content versioning and distribution system that focuses on easily moving statically generated content
between environments.  Teamed up with appilcations like [DocPad](https://github.com/bevry/docpad) and 
[Octopress](http://octopress.org/), it provides a fast system for getting interactive web content out of development,
through testing and into production.

Vagrant
=======

To run this project in a vagrant box first run "mvn clean install" then vagrant up.

This will build a vagrant instance with jboss 7, apache2, and a deployer deployed in it.

The jboss admin user is "admin" with a password of "p@$$w0rd".
